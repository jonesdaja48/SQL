Business Insights:
	This analysis gives insight into how product reviews can help a business understand which merchandise to continue pushing and marketing to consumers.
    
    I used Excel to clean up some of the data by getting rid of columns I knew would not be necessary for the analysis. This made it easier to view the data,
     and get a bette idea of of how to answer business questions the merchandising team would have. I then used SQL to figure out what the average salary was, as this 
     would help me to figure out what were the top 50 products and brands based off of the ratings. Each SQL statement helped me find out which products and brands were the 
     most popular among consumers, which categories were the most popular, and whether characteristics (such as Sephora Exclusive) affect a product's rating. These insights
     will give the merchandising team a better idea on which products, brands, and product categories to focus on.
